<details>

```

</details>

## Usage

```tsx
import { DBButton } from '@db-ui/react-components';
...
<DBButton icon="account" onClick={()=>{console.log("Test")}}>Test</DBButton>
...
```

## Custom Events

We do not provide every event on every component. If you are missing an event please [add an issue](https://github.com/db-ui/mono/issues).

As a workaround you can use the forwardRef:

### Ref on component

```tsx
import { DBButton } from "@db-ui/react-components";
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
	const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);

	useEffect(() => {
		if (buttonRef.current) {
			buttonRef.current.onmouseenter = (ev) => {
				console.log(ev);
			};
		}
	}, [buttonRef]);

	return <DBButton ref={buttonRef}>Test</DBButton>;
};
```
